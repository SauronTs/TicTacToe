# TicTacToe

A very simple game everyone should know. 
I wrote it to test a few things out.
A human player plays against the AI.
The AI itself is actually unbeatable, the best thing you can achieve is a draw.

#### Things used
No graphics libraries. Only simple text output.
The AI decides their moves using the minimax algorithm, whereby the complete tree is computated and used.
